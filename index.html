I decided to start writing diary entries here. <br />
I struggle with finishing projects, I struggle with doing anything at all in life to be honest. <br />
My attention is shortlived. So I will leave at least some notes on this page I guess. <br />
This way I can at least feel like I've done something. <br />
At least see some kind of progress , some kind of continuation.<br />
I will have to think about what I will do with this page. <br />
Maybe take one day and do something with it. <br />
And then I will leave these notes on a subpage maybe. <br />
My online diary<br />
